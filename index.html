      <div><button> yet it's still here, the persistent sense of loss. The magic of the Internet-the recession of the material world in favor of a world of ideas-is not pure delight. It seems we are missing something very worthwhile and identity-forming from our predigital lives. Is it a handwritten letter? Is it an analog phone call? Is it a quality of celluloid film, a multivolume encyclopedia, or a leather-bound datebook? Is it a way of thinking or being or even </button></div>
      <div><button> the products of thought. This includes abstract objects such as scientific theories, stories, myths and works of art.[4] A world 3 object is something along the lines of a meta-object or a form of being. But, world 3 is not to be conceived as a Platonic realm, because unlike the Platonic world of forms, which is non changing and exists independently of human beings, Popper's world 3 is created by human beings and is not fixed. It corresponds corresponds to </button></div>
      <div><button> a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will </button></div>
      <div><button> is thinking about you right now. They’re trying to imagine what you’re wearing, what you’re eating, what you’re texting your sister. They want to know if you believe in God and if you have any recently deceased pets. They’re desperate to discover what makes you horny. Anxious. Mad. They study your tweets and Facebook posts like Jane Goodall studies chimps, trying to understand what’s going on inside that mysterious head of yours. </button></div>
      <div><button> thrives in one place will thrive in another. You just have to find a sufficiently virulent business plan, condense it into a three-ring binder ― its DNA ― xerox it, and embed it in the fertile lining of a well-traveled highway, preferably one with a lef- turn lane. Then the growth will expand until it runs up against its property lines. In olden times, you’d wander down to Mom’s Café for a bite to eat and a cup of joe, and you would feel right at home. It </button></div>
      <div><button> opposed to all innovation, all change, but I am determined to understand what’s happening. Because I don’t choose just to sit and let the juggernaut roll over me. Many people seem to think that if you talk about something recent, you’re in favor of it. The exact opposite is true in my case. Anything I talk about is almost certainly something I’m resolutely against. And it seems to me the best way to oppose it is to understand it. And then you know where to turn </button></div>
      <div><button> social outcomes are based on what we do. To expand on that definition, it is understanding that some things in society may lead to a certain outcome.The factors mentioned are examples like norms and motives, the social context, and the social action which all affects others. The things we do are shaped by: the situation we are in, the values we have, and the way people around us act. These devices are examined to find how they all relate to </button></div>
      <div><button> anthropology, liminality (from the Latin word līmen, meaning "a threshold") is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, when participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status but have not yet begun the transition to the status they will hold when the rite is complete. During a rite's liminal stage, participants "stand at the threshold" between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or </button></div>
      <div><button> user could punch in any time in history, go to any place on Earth, and see what was happening there at the specified time. It was no more complicated than a SimCity or Civilization, the difference being that it was designed by educators to show everything we know about what actually happened on Earth at any given time. So if you went to 12th century Paris, you could watch the early portions of Notre Dame cathedral being erected. If you went to </button></div>
      <div><button> title "The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There's a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, 'Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.' This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages </button></div>
      <div><button> blackness of outer space and pay attention to the stars, especially if they seem to order themselves into constellations. “Common as the air” meant something worthless, but Hackworth knew that every breath of air that Fiona drew, lying in her little bed at night, just a silver flow in the moonlight, was used by her body to make skin and hair and bones. The air became Fiona, and deserving—no, demanding—of love. Ordering matter was the sole endeavor of Life, </button></div>
      <div><button> or world-view, attributed to Plato, that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. According to this theory, ideas in this sense, often capitalized and translated as "Ideas" or "Forms," are the non-physical essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations. Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily Socrates) of his dialogues who sometimes suggests that </button></div>
      <div><button> he were leaving himself behind, and by giving himself up to the movement of the streets, by reducing himself to a seeing eye, he was able to escape the obligation to think, and this, more than anything else, brought him a measure of peace, a salutary emptiness within... By wandering aimlessly, all places became equal and it no longer mattered where he was. On his best walks he was able to feel that he was nowhere. And this, finally was all he ever </button></div>
      <div><button> opposing view to realism is one called nominalism, which at its strongest maintains that universals are verbal constructs and that they do not inhere in objects or pre-exist them. Therefore, universals in this view are something which are peculiar to human cognition and language. The French philosopher and theologian Roscellinus (1050–1125) was an early, prominent proponent of this view. His particular view was that universals are little more than vocal </button></div>
      <div><button> seen people make really deep, lasting relationships via the Internet with people they've never even met in real life. Like a sibling of a friend of mine had a couple friends he literally talked to almost daily on the phone that he had originally met playing video games on xbox live. Like he had met them irl at that point, but only just for the sake of meeting them. They were already great friends before that point. Because what makes friends is a sort of </button></div>
      <div><button> the Internet as an artistic medium (computers, networks and code), as an environment (media ecology) and as "the masterpiece of human civilization" (à la Virginia Heffernan). Our focus will be on producing creative contributions to this collaborative space by learning the core coding languages of the web, HTML and CSS. While we will occasionally be discussing the contributions of self-identified artists (from the net.art movement of the 1990s for example) we will </button></div>
      <div><button> can be used to genuinely welcome someone to navigating the web itself or to the internet culture. Alternatively, it can be used as a sarcastic insult to mock those who are not familiar with how internet culture works, for example, in response to someone being disgusted by something they saw online or reposted outdated content. It is commonly found as a caption on image macros and GIFs, sometimes paired with the phrase "I will be your guide." </button></div>
      <div><button> of course the Internet is not life. In fact it is a highly artificial regime, with tight rules and rituals that organize its text, music, and images. That's why the Internet becomes more deeply meaningful and moving when "read" as an aesthetic object than lived or reported on as firsthand human experience. That human experience is art, where art is considered closer to a game than to a deception. Our proxies in this game are our avatars: </button></div>
      <div><button> identically to the way we hear the world. When audio is captured with a binaural microphone like the hooke verse (www.Hookeaudio.Com), it is capturing the exact location of every sound source and where it is in relation to the recordist upon capture. When you listen back to binaural audio recording on any 2 channel system you will feel like you are there in the moment, hearing it identically to the way the recordist did when they were capturing it. Hear for</button></div>
      <div><button> distinction between langue (an idealized abstraction of language) and parole (language as actually used in daily life). He argued that a "sign" is composed of a "signified" (signifié, i.e. an abstract concept or idea) and a "signifier" (signifiant, i.e. the perceived sound/visual image). (2) Because different languages have different words to refer to the same objects or concepts, there is no intrinsic reason why a specific signifier is used </button></div>
      <div><button> between footage shot on 35mm film stock and an Arri Alexa, industry standards for film and digital, respectively. Both have been processed to achieve what Yedlin says is “the look culturally associated with a traditional all-film system,” the kind people like Nolan say can only be achieved by actually shooting on film. Except, as Yedlin tells Polygon, when screened in theaters to an array of industry professionals, almost no one could tell the </button></div>
      <div><button> on the metaphysics of the internet or the World Wide Web? I feel like there are some interesting questions to be asked, e.g.: is the internet a concrete object or an abstract object? in a vein similar to the above, is the World Wide Web the hardware that it is hosted on, the lines of HTML that describe it, or the "information space" through which users navigate? how do actions performed by agents on the World Wide Web differ from actions performed "in real life," </button></div>   
      <div><button> great deal of philosophy doesn’t really deserve much of a place of the world,” he says. “Philosophy in some quarters has become self-indulgent, clever play in a vacuum that’s not dealing of problems of any intrinsic interest.” Much if not all philosophical work in analytic metaphysics, for example, is “willfully cut off from any serious issues… much of philosophy is little more than a “luxury decoration on society,” and he complains many of the </button></div>
      <div><button> So far, so good. Chess is a deep and important human artifact, about which much of value has been written. But some philosophical research projects are more like working out the truths of chmess. Chmess is just like chess except that the king can move two squares in any direction, not one. I just invented it—though no doubt others have explored it in depth to see if it is worth playing. Probably it isn’t. It probably has other names. I didn’t bother investigating </button></div>
